    "# Assignment #1 - Basic Data Exploration, Visualization, and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you'll load some data into a python notebook, and use some basic functions to do some basic analysis. Each section asks you to either calculate some answers or explore some information found in the data. When generating your answers, try to think about a few factors that can make your code better:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Present the answers clearly. Use the markdown cells, code comments, and formatting to help make your answers readable. One of the features of notebooks is that they allow us to combine code and commentary, and we need to ensure both are readable. Refer to the guide in the guides folder of the exercises workbook for an explaination and examples of different formatting. \n",
    "<li> Make your code clear. It is easy to make sense of small pieces of code, for short periods of time, so if your code makes little sense here, it won't really hurt your ability to find the answers. If you need to come back to it later, or others need to edit it, having code that doesn't make sense is a big issue. Use things like clearly named variables, comments, and spacing to make things readable. Even in this course, if you are looking back to something from 2 months ago for the project, it is far easier to understand code that is cleaned up a little. \n",
    "<li> Structure the code well. If there is some kind of repetitive task, it should likely be moved into a function. If there is something that happens several times, it should be in a loop. Having well structured code makes it easy to reuse stuff later, understand how things work, debug errors, and share code with others. This is something to keep in the back of your minds, right now you may not have much experience to lean on to judge how things should be, as you read, adjust, and write code it will become more clear. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will be graded in two portions:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> 50% - Correctness and functionality. Parts of the assignment (the functions you are asked to write) will be graded on whether they work correctly and generate correct answers. </li>\n",
    "<li> 50% -Analysis and presentation. Parts of the assignment (the markdown cells you are asked to fill in) will be graded on whether they present the answers clearly, and whether the analysis is correct. </li>\n",
